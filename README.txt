This is a README file for comparing pure binary search with its 1/5 - 4/5 variation

Description 
1. An array of sorted random integers is created in the Main java file.
2. Enter a search key by updating the value of the key variable in the main java file. 
3. Two types of searches are run on the current array: the 1/5 - 4/5 binary search and the pure binary search.
4. The program outputs if the search was a success (the search key was found in the array) or a failure (the search key was not found in the array).
5. The program outputs the number of comparisons made by the 1/5 - 4/5 binary search and the pure binary search.
